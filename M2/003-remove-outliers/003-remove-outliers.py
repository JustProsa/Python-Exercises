# When analysing data collected as part of a science experiment it may be desirable to remove
# the most extreme values before performing other calculations.
# Write a function that takes a list of values and an non-negative integer, n, as its parameters.
# The function should create a new copy of the list with the n largest elements and the n smallest elements removed.
# Then it should return the new copy of the list as the functionâ€™s only result.
# The order of the elements in the returned list does not have to match the order of the elements in the original list.
# Write a main program that demonstrates your function.
# It should read a list of numbers from the user and remove the two largest and two smallest values from it by calling
# the function described previously. Display the list with the outliers removed, followed by the original list.
# Your program should generate an appropriate error message if the user enters less than 4 values.
